Declarative (SQL) - Find result VS. Imperative (Java) - Steps to find result

CRUD
Create, Rename, Update, Delete

NULL, Nothing equals NULL (Any operations performed will result in NULL)

IS Operator 
Filter values that are NULL, NOT NULL, True, False
-- SELECT * FROM <table> WHERE <field> IS [NOT] NULL;

BETWEEN 

IN
Check if a value matches any value in a list of values

LIKE
Filter based on criteria, build patters to match, Postgres - ONLY Text comparison -> must cast
% any number of characters, _ 1 character
-- Examples: LIKE '%2' - fields that end with 2 
             LIKE '%2%' - fields that have 2 anywhere in value
             LIKE '_00%' - fields that have 0 as second and third character and anything after
             LIKE '%200%' - fields that have 200 anywhere in value
             LIKE '2_%_%' - values that start with 2 and are atleast 3 characters in length
             LIEK '2___3' - 5 digit values that start with 2 and end with 3
     
ILIKE
Case insenstive matching
             
CAST
    CAST(salary as text);
    salary::text;
    
TIME
ALWAYS use UTC as a standard
-- SET TIME ZONE 'UTC';
-- ISO-8601 -> YYYY--MM--DDTHH:MM:SS

DISTINCT
Evaluating multiple columns based on combination of columns
  SELECT DISTINCT <col1>, <col2>
  FROM
  <table>;
  
ORDER BY
Sort data either ascending or descending by column
  SELECT * FROM <table> ORDER BY <column> [ASC/DESC];

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Multi Table SELECT
Use WHERE to link to the two tables
-- Example: 
  SELECT a.emp_no, CONCAT(a.first_name, a.last_name) AS "name",
         b.salary
  FROM employees as a, salaries as b
  WHERE a.emp_no = b.emp_no;
  
JOINS
Take a column from one table that can map to a column of another table (link PRIMARY key to FOREIGN key)

INNER JOIN
If you have columns that link table a to table b, you can use an inner join (both tables have employee number)
-- Example: 
  SELECT a.emp_no, CONCAT(a.first_name, a.last_name) AS "name",
         b.salary
  FROM employees as a
  INNER JOIN salaries as b ON b.emp_no = a.emp_no  -- Join the column salaries from table b to table a
  ORDER BY a.emp_no ASC;
--Example: (3 Table Inner Join)
  SELECT a.emp_no, CONCAT(a.first_name, a.last_name) AS "name",
         b.salary,
         c.title,
         c.from_date AS "promoted on"
  FROM employees AS a
  INNER JOIN salaries as b on a.emp_no = b.emp_no  -- ON acts like WHERE
  INNER JOIN titles AS c ON c.emp_no = a.emp_no 
  AND (b.from_date = c.from_date OR (c.from_date = (b.from_date + interval '2 days'))
  ORDER BY a.emp_no;
  
  SELF JOIN
  When a table has a foreign key referencing its primary key
  --Example: 
    SELECT a.id, a.name as "employee", b.name as "supervisor name"
    FROM employee as a, employee as b
    WHERE a.supervisorId = b.id;
