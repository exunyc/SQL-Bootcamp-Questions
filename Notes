Declarative (SQL) - Find result VS. Imperative (Java) - Steps to find result

CRUD
Create, Rename, Update, Delete

NULL, Nothing equals NULL (Any operations performed will result in NULL)

IS Operator 
Filter values that are NULL, NOT NULL, True, False
-- SELECT * FROM <table> WHERE <field> IS [NOT] NULL;

BETWEEN 

IN
Check if a value matches any value in a list of values

LIKE
Filter based on criteria, build patters to match, Postgres - ONLY Text comparison -> must cast
% any number of characters, _ 1 character
-- Examples: LIKE '%2' - fields that end with 2 
             LIKE '%2%' - fields that have 2 anywhere in value
             LIKE '_00%' - fields that have 0 as second and third character and anything after
             LIKE '%200%' - fields that have 200 anywhere in value
             LIKE '2_%_%' - values that start with 2 and are atleast 3 characters in length
             LIEK '2___3' - 5 digit values that start with 2 and end with 3
     
ILIKE
Case insenstive matching
             
CAST
    CAST(salary as text);
    salary::text;
    
TIME
ALWAYS use UTC as a standard
-- SET TIME ZONE 'UTC';
-- ISO-8601 -> YYYY--MM--DDTHH:MM:SS

DISTINCT
Evaluating multiple columns based on combination of columns
  SELECT DISTINCT <col1>, <col2>
  FROM
  <table>;
